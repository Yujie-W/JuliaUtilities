# JuliaUtilities


## About
A repo to store my utility Julia packages. If you plan to use the included packages in a dynamic environment (e.g., a registered package), it is recommended to use the registered packages. If you
    plan to use the included packages in a static environment (e.g., a research project), you may choose to use the entire repo for more features including the unregistered packages. Currently, the
    registered packages include
- ConstrainedRootSolvers
- NetcdfIO
- PkgUtility
- PlotPlants
